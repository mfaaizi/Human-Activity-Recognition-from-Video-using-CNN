# Human-Activity-Recognition-from-Video-using-CNN
A deep learning-based system that classifies human actions from short video clips using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model learns spatial patterns from frame sequences to identify activities such as waving, clapping, and walking. This project demonstrates the full pipelineâ€”from frame extraction.
